Total hiking time is 30 to 45 minutes.    </p>       <p>     A 10-minute trail winds through the forest to connect the campground with the picnic area and swimming lagoon. The Columbia River trail parallels the river from the south end of the campground and connects to the day-use and group camping areas. There are 3 short trails leading to the Columbia River. This is a favourite spot for visitors for relaxing and strolling. There is no better vantage point to view the peaks of the Columbia Mountains.

      "description": "The canoe route starts on the north shore of Lamprey Lake, where there is a camping area and vehicle parking site. A short paddle across Lamprey Lake to the south shore brings you to the first portage (1.5 kilometres). All portages are marked with white triangles. This portage ascends gradually to an undulating ridge and then drops down to Anzac Lake. Canoe rests are located along the trail and boardwalk through the wet areas makes the trail easy to travel.    <br>       <br>    The next lake is Anzac Lake, which contains many water lily filled bays and an island with a good camping site. This doglegged lake is a great place for viewing birds and wildlife.    <br>       <br>    A short portage trail (0.5 kilometres) from Anzac Lake leads to the east end of Stepp Lake. Head winds are often encountered upon reaching Stepp Lake. A campsite is provided nearby at the Anzac end of the portage trail. Stepp Lake has many bays and beaches to explore. Two campsites are located along the north shore of Stepp lake. It is possible to hike through the bush to Tableland Mountain from these campsites; however there are no trails maintained. On the return trip down Stepp Lake, it is often possible to rig your tent fly as a sail.    <br>       <br>    The west end of Stepp Lake is narrow and you must canoe through a couple of turns before arriving at a campsite and the portage to Kidprice Lake. This is the longest portage at 2.2 kilometres, and it travels over mostly level ground. Once Kidprice Lake is reached there is a great camping area at the end of the portage with a nice beach and sunset views of the snow-capped peaks. Breezes off the lake keep the bugs out of this campsite.    <br>       <br>    Four kilometres up Kidprice Lake on the north shore, the lower Nanika River begins and a short distance down stream the river drops over the Nanika Falls. Beach your boat on the West side of the river mouth at the water metering station. A 500m trail leads down to the falls. Do not approach the falls by canoe as you may not be able to escape the strong current.    <br>       <br>    Some canoeists continue down Kidprice Lake. There are beaches to camp on, but no maintained campsites are available. It is possible to access Nanika Lake by lining your canoe up the upper Nanika River; however this is a long (8 km) and arduous journey and log jams are often present. No portage trail is available.    <ul>         <li>      <a href=\"nanika-kidprice-park.kmz\">      Google Earth KMZ file of Trails and Campsites</a>, must have Google Earth and/or and Google Maps installed.</li></ul>",

When someone has a fish on, please reel in and give them room to land their fish. When arriving to fish beside someone, give them room to make safe casts.     </li>         <li>      Avoid monopolizing good pools for long periods. Give others a chance to get in and try out a productive pool.     </li>         <li>      Be courteous to others on shore. Be aware of people behind you when making your back cast.     </li>         <li>      Observe your quota. Please consult <a href=\"/explore/fishreg.html\">      fishing regulations and DFO</a>. The daily quota for sockeye salmon is posted by DFO.     </li>        </ol>       <p>     The experience at the Babine River is valued by many.

Knowledgeable guides can lead visitors through the caves to discover this magical world of crystal formations and ancient fossils firsthand.

The shortest tour is not the easiest considering the narrow vertical-squeeze entrance, but the 1 hr Main Cave Adventure (age 5+) features rock scrambling and a ride down Canada&rsquo;s only Cave Slide! The Multi-Cave Experience (age 8+) provides 3 hours of cave exploring that combines the best features and challenges for adventurous families and novice cave explorers including a climb up an underground waterfall! Those wanting maximum adventure can sign on to the Extreme Cave &amp; Rappel (age 13+), a five-hour excursion that has explorers rappel down a seven-storey waterfall that leads into the &ldquo;China Shop Passage&rdquo; to reach the very end of this amazing cave with a climb out on a cable ladder. Not for the faint of heart! An outdoor rappel training session is included in the price or available as a stand-alone adventure (age7+).    </p>       <p>     All caving equipment is included on the guided tours with certified cave guides.

      "description": "<p>     There are opportunities to spelunk on the Stone Corral Trail. Small caves can be found in the limestone outcrops.    </p>       <p>     At the far end of the Stone Corral, beneath the steepest cliffs, lies the large entrance to Corral Cave. Although this cave is only 20 metres deep, it contains a number of fascinating features. The walls are smooth and vertical and the ceiling is high, making for an easy walk-in cave. The floor is rock-strewn, and there are a number of large perpetual drips. In spring and early summer the floor of the cave is a dramatic collection of large icicles. On the left wall, about halfway in, there is a small round hole. This is a typical phreatic tube. The initial dissolution process that widens the cracks underground occurs below the water table. Because of the very slow movement of the water and because it completely fills the crack, the result is a perfectly round tube. Later in the history of a cave when the water-table drops and air enters, if water is still passing through the crack it will selectively erode the bottom portion. The resulting V-shape is known as vadose, as opposed to the round phreatic features. At the end of the cave, if a flashlight is shone up into the top corner, there are a few tiny stalactites. Beyond these is a long descending tongue of a softer white substance, moonsmilk, an organic form of calcite. It is gooey when wet, with a texture like cottage cheese, but crumbly and powdery when dry. The origin of the name is traced to Europe, where the exact translation means &ldquo;gnome&rsquo;s milk&rdquo;. It was used in medieval times as a wound dressing and recent research has shown the appropriateness of this remedy, as moonsmilk contains a number of substances with antibacterial properties. Overhead and along the wall there are also some beautiful calcite flowstone walls, as well as another attractive collection of small stalactites at the drip sites.    </p>       <p>     Another cave can be found along the trail as it leads away from the cliff-edge and crosses a gully. There is a tiny sinkhole with a small opening in the rock-face, this is one of the entrances of Porcupine Cave. Do not enter this opening! Instead, proceed and enter a second sinkhole just over the ridge, as the entrance to the cave from this aspect is larger. Porcupine Cave is 10 metres long, and joins the two sinkholes. It is a classic solutional feature created by the dissolving of limestone by slowly moving water. It is fairly narrow at either end but opens up into a chamber in the middle with standing room. There are fine coral fossils on the ceiling in this chamber. There is also cave popcorn, which is recognized by its knob-like shape, resulting from concentric layering of tiny calcite crystals. The floor of this cave is covered with old porcupine droppings, hence the name.    </p>       <p>     <strong>Caves are fragile environments that need to be treated with the greatest respect. Under no circumstances should you touch the walls, take anything or leave anything.</strong> </p>",

There are many classic ski tours that can be completed for parties based out of the Kain Hut basin, and the park is the starting point for the Bugaboos to Rogers Pass high-level ski traverse. Anyone considering visiting the park in the winter should be aware that the terrain is predominantly high alpine and very complex, with few safe options when avalanche danger is elevated. Because the Conrad Kain Hut can be threatened by avalanches, it is closed from November 16 to April 30 each year. Ski touring parties wishing to base camp in the vicinity of the main Bugaboo Spires (Bugaboo, Snowpatch, Pigeon etc) are required to stay at Applebee Dome campground where toilet facilities are located. </p>",

The staircase has handrails and another rail at knee level.    </p>       <p>     Children must be accompanied by an adult. After the first flight of stairs, the trail levels out to an area perched on the edge of the canyon opposite the base of the waterfall and fenced in by a chain link fence. The area offers a stunning view of the two-tiered cascade and the steep canyon walls. The stairs continue up to a series of three wooden viewing platforms each offering a slightly different view of the falls as the stairs climb higher up the canyon wall. The third, and largest platform, offers the best view looking both down on the falls and the other platforms, and upstream to a corner where the canyon narrows and a pool forms.    </p>       <p>     There are fantastic views of Okanagan Lake and the Fintry Delta. Saskatoon bushes cling to life on the edge of the canyon beside the platform which has a small triangular bench. Above this are the remnants of the irrigation system. There is no designated trail beyond the chain link fence that blocks off access to the irrigation system. For your own safety and the preservation of the park, obey posted signs and keep to designated trails away from the steep cliffs of the canyon.

Wolverines are little known and rarely seen predators living in and suspected to be breeding in this area. In the low elevation forested area, marten and fisher (blue-listed) use the older forests, while moose, mule deer, coyotes and wolves tend to use the area around natural openings, burned areas and old cut blocks. The low elevation forest between Hell&rsquo;s Bells Creek and Oliver Creek provides mule deer winter range. High elevation wetlands in the Upper Price Creek drainage are likely important for migratory waterfowl in spring and fall. Tailed frogs (blue-listed) have been found across the Skeena River from Oliver Creek, and may live in small tributaries within the Protected Area. High breeding populations of rough-skinned newts live in small ponds near Coyote Creek at the northern extent of their range.
